Raspberry pi Pool monitoring project

This project is about monitoring a pool using a raspberry pi and a bunch of small sensors .

2 temperature sensors (DS18b20) waterproof. Connected using a 5k resistor (google how to connect to raspberry pi, fairly easy)

2 float sensor. simple foam sensor with a magnet, closing a circuit based on whether there's water or not. place one above another, will help knwoing water level in the pool and determine if we should open a valve to refill the pool.

1 ph sensor

1 ORP sensor
